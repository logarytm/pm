This is a stupid, crude, quick&dirty software installer for Linux. It might
work on macOS, MSYS, BSD or other systems, but it has not been tested there.

Usage:

```
pm-install hello 2.10
```

Package manifests are in the [repository](https://github.com/logarytm/pm/tree/master/repository)
directory.
